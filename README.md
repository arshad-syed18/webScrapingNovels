# Web Scraping Novels
This is a Python program that scrapes novels from a website and saves them as text files. The program uses the Beautiful Soup library to parse the HTML of the website and extract the novel content.
This code was written as a past time to see if its possible to make a dataset to train NLP on said dataset.
